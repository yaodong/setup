# Git Commit Skill

Automate git commits with consistent, well-formatted messages.

## When to Use

- After completing a feature, bug fix, or refactoring task
- When the user explicitly requests a commit
- When staged changes are ready to be committed

## Commit Workflow

### Step 1: Gather Context

Run these commands in parallel to understand the current state:

```bash
git status                    # See all changes
git diff                      # Review unstaged changes
git diff --staged             # Review staged changes
git log --oneline -5          # Check recent commit style
```

### Step 2: Analyze Changes

Review the diff output to understand:
- What files were modified, added, or deleted
- The nature of changes (new feature, bug fix, refactor, docs, etc.)
- The scope of impact

### Step 3: Generate Commit Message and Ask for Confirmation

Write a commit message following these rules, then **ask the user to confirm before committing**:

**Style: Simple Imperative**
- Start with a verb: Add, Fix, Update, Remove, Refactor, Improve
- Keep the subject line under 72 characters
- Focus on "why" not "what" (the diff shows "what")

**Examples:**
- `Add user authentication via OAuth`
- `Fix null pointer in payment processing`
- `Update dependencies to address security vulnerabilities`
- `Remove deprecated API endpoints`
- `Refactor database queries for better performance`

**Message Format:**
```
<subject line>

- <change 1>
- <change 2>
```

Keep it concise. Only include the bullet list if there are multiple distinct changes.

### Step 4: Ask for Confirmation

Before committing, present the proposed commit message and files to the user. Use AskUserQuestion to confirm:
- Show the commit message
- List files to be committed
- Ask "Proceed with this commit?"

**Only proceed if the user confirms.**

### Step 5: Create Commit and Push

After user confirmation:

```bash
git add <relevant files>
git commit -m "<commit message>"
git push
```

### Step 6: Verify

Run `git status` to confirm the commit and push succeeded.

## Safety Rules

- **Never** force push (`git push --force`)
- **Never** skip hooks (`--no-verify`)
- **Never** amend commits that have been pushed
- **Never** commit secrets or credentials (.env, API keys, etc.)
- **Always** verify with user before committing if unsure

## Do Not Commit

- `.env` files or any file containing secrets
- `credentials.json`, API keys, tokens
- Large binary files unless explicitly requested
- Generated files that should be in `.gitignore`
